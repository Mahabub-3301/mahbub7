# Food Waste Management System

## Overview

The Food Waste Management System is an innovative solution designed to reduce food waste, a major issue in the global food supply chain. It connects restaurants with buyers (individuals or businesses) to purchase excess food at discounted rates and also facilitates food donations to charities.

## How It Works

### 1. Restaurant Side (Suppliers):		

Food Listing: Restaurants can list surplus or near-expiry food items that are still safe to consume.

Discounted Prices: These items are offered at reduced prices to encourage buyers to purchase them before they go to waste.

Donation Option: Restaurants can choose to donate unsold food to local charities or food banks.

### 2. Buyer Side:

Browse Listings: Buyers (individuals or organizations) can search for food items by location, type, or discount percentage.

Order & Payment: Buyers can purchase food using integrated payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

Pickup/Delivery: Buyers can pick up food from the restaurant or request delivery if available.

### 3. Donation Management:

Charity Listings: Charities can register on the platform to receive food donations.

Tracking Donations: The platform maintains a record of donations, ensuring transparency for restaurants and charities.

### 4. Geolocation and Search:

Google Maps API: Displays food listings within a specific radius to help buyers locate nearby restaurants.

### 5. Reviews and Ratings:

User Feedback: Buyers can rate food quality, restaurant service, and the donation experience to maintain accountability and trust.
